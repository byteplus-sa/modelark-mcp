# Multi-Generation

The server supports two mechanisms for producing multiple outputs from a
single client request: **native provider batch** (one API call, many
outputs) and **client-side parallel variation** (many independent API calls
with bounded concurrency).

## Native provider batch

Seedream supports generating multiple images in a single provider API call
via the `max_images` parameter. This is a native capability of the BytePlus
API and is only supported by **Lite** and **4.x** model families.

**How it works:**

1. The client passes `max_images` (1-15) on `seedream_generate_image`.
2. The handler validates it against the capability registry:
   - Lite and 4.x allow batch; Pro rejects `max_images > 1`.
3. The provider adapter translates `max_images` into
   `sequential_image_generation: "auto"` with
   `sequential_image_generation_options: {"max_images": N}`.
4. The provider returns all N images in a single response. Each image is
   persisted as a separate `ArtifactRef`.

This is a **single `POST /images/generations` call** — one request, one
response, multiple outputs. It is the most efficient path and should be
preferred over variations when the model supports it.

| Model family | Supports `max_images` | Max images |
|---|---|---|
| **Pro** (`seedream_pro`) | No | 1 |
| **Lite** (`seedream_lite`) | Yes | 15 |
| **4.x** (`seedream_4x`) | Yes | 15 |

## Client-side parallel variations

When a product does not support native batch (or when the client needs
per-variation control like distinct prompts, seeds, or media inputs), the
`*_variations` tools make multiple independent API calls in parallel.

### Products with variation support

| Tool | Product | Uses native batch? | Parallel mechanism |
|---|---|---|---|
| `seedream_generate_image_variations` | Seedream | No (always parallel calls) | `run_variation_batch` |
| `seed_audio_generate_variations` | Seed Audio | No | `run_variation_batch` |
| `seedance_create_task_variations` | Seedance | No | `run_variation_batch` |

### How it works

The shared helper [`run_variation_batch`] in `tools/_parallel.py`:

1. Generates distinct seeds for each variation via `generate_seeds`:
   - `base_seed=None` → provider randomizes each (seed not recorded).
   - `base_seed=-1` → client picks random seeds (recorded for reproducibility).
   - `base_seed=N` → deterministic sequence `[N, N+1, N+2, ...]` modulo
     `2147483648`.
2. Resolves prompts via `resolve_prompts`: either per-variation prompts or
   the same base prompt repeated N times.
3. Launches N coroutines, each calling the provider API independently.
4. Bounds concurrency with an `asyncio.Semaphore` (default from
   `DEFAULT_MAX_CONCURRENT` in `tools/_cost.py`).
5. Applies a per-coroutine timeout via `asyncio.wait_for`.
6. Collects all results via `asyncio.gather(return_exceptions=True)` and
   builds a `VariationSummary` with per-variation success/failure tracking.

### Seedance variations

Seedance variations are fundamentally different from Seedream/Seed Audio
because each variation creates a **separate async task**. The client must
poll each task ID via `seedance_get_task` to retrieve results. The
`seedance_create_task_variations` tool returns task IDs immediately; the
actual video generation runs asynchronously on the provider side.

### Cost

All variation tools log a cost estimate before dispatching calls. The
estimate is based on the number of variations and the product type. Actual
billing is determined by the provider and reflected in the per-response
usage fields.

## Choosing the right mechanism

| Scenario | Use |
|---|---|
| Multiple images, same prompt, Lite or 4.x model | `max_images` on `seedream_generate_image` |
| Multiple images, Pro model | `seedream_generate_image_variations` |
| Per-variation prompts, seeds, or reference images | `*_variations` tool |
| Multiple audio outputs | `seed_audio_generate_variations` |
| Multiple video tasks | `seedance_create_task_variations` |
